## 1. 🎯 Title and Abstract

- [ ] 1.1 Title is ≤ 15 words. Check for generic phrasing (e.g., “A Novel Framework...”) and overly narrow focus—aim for concise but informative.
- [ ] 1.2 Title better combines both the **problem** and the **solution**, and includes at least one technical keyword (e.g., OOD detection, graph learning).
- [ ] 1.3 Title avoids rare or ambiguous abbreviations. Terms like LLM, AI, and ML are acceptable; avoid AD unless context is clear as they can be advertisement or anomaly detection.
- [ ] 1.4 Abstract includes all four key components: (1) problem/task definition, (2) proposed method or idea, (3) main results, and (4) broader impact or significance.
- [ ] 1.5 Abstract avoids undefined abbreviations and vague descriptors (e.g., “important”, “novel”, “state-of-the-art” without context).
- [ ] 1.6 Bonus: Abstract includes at least one concrete, quantitative result or insight to make the work stand out. For instance, our methods archives 11.2x acceleration in test time inference for jailbreak detection.

## 2. 📚 Introduction

- [ ] 2.1 The main problem or task is clearly defined within the first two paragraphs.
- [ ] 2.2 Motivation includes either (a) real-world use cases or (b) citations to prior work—ideally both.
- [ ] 2.3 The introduction ends with a brief overview of the proposed method and its name.
- [ ] 2.4 Contributions are explicitly itemized (e.g., “(1) first framework for ..., (2) new dataset for ..., (3) extensive evaluation on ...”).
- [ ] 2.5 Each contribution is specific and verifiable—avoid vague claims such as “we provide insights” or “we improve understanding.”
- [ ] 2.6 Bonus: Include a compelling figure on the first page—e.g., comparison to prior work, performance highlight, or visual explanation of the core idea.

## 3. 🔍 Related Work

- [ ] 3.1 All cited works are connected to your method, baseline, or task.
- [ ] 3.2 At least one baseline from the top-3 most cited recent papers on the topic is mentioned.
- [ ] 3.3 Related work does not exceed 1.5 pages (unless survey-style paper).
- [ ] 3.4 You may use LLMs for searching the related work, but double triple check each of the paper -- do not trust LLMs!!!!
- [ ] 3.5 Bonus: use related work section to introduce baseline algorithms -- show a table for your proposal better than the existing ones

## 4. 🧪 Method

- [ ] 4.1 All symbols are defined before use.
- [ ] 4.2 Each equation is referenced with inline explanation (e.g., “Eq. (3) defines the loss over…”). If an equation is never referenced, consider making it inline to save space.
- [ ] 4.3 All modules or components of the method are illustrated or described in text or figures.
- [ ] 4.4 Each subsection ideally aligns with parts of the overview figure. Add a short summary paragraph before diving into subsections.
- [ ] 4.5 You do not need both overview figure and pseudo code in the main text -- move the pseudo code to the appendix
- [ ] 4.6 The method is reproducible without referring to the appendix or external code—reviewers should understand everything from the main text.
- [ ] 4.7 Bonus: Can anything be removed from this section without reducing clarity? Do not hesitate to cut: more math ≠ better paper.

## 5. 📊 Experiments

- [ ] 5.1 At least 3 datasets are used (unless the paper introduces a new dataset).
- [ ] 5.2 At least 3 baseline methods are compared. Are they state-of-the-art? Justify why these baselines are chosen.
- [ ] 5.3 At least 1 ablation study is included.
- [ ] 5.4 Standard deviation or confidence intervals are reported where appropriate.
- [ ] 5.5 Hardware environment, software libraries, and hyperparameter settings are described.
- [ ] 5.6 Negative results (if any) are explained, not omitted—failure cases are valuable.
- [ ] 5.7 Evaluation metrics are clearly defined and justified.
- [ ] 5.8 All figures and tables are referenced in the main text.
- [ ] 5.9 Beyond showing numbers and saying “we perform well,” at least one deeper insight or analysis is provided (e.g., why it works, where it fails).
- [ ] 5.10 Bonus: Think about how easy others can reproduce your work? If you have any "dirty tricks" -- remove them pls.

## 6. 🧾 Writing Quality and Style

- [ ] 6.1 All abbreviations are defined at first use (even ML, LLM, etc.) -- do not redefine them again and again.
- [ ] 6.2 No sentence exceeds 25 words without a comma or period.
- [ ] 6.3 No paragraph exceeds 10 lines.
- [ ] 6.4 Passive voice usage < 30% of the total number of sentences.
- [ ] 6.5 Bonus: Have you noticed that your paper are full of the fancy LLM words, like encompass, intricate, etc?

## 7. 🖼️ Figures and Tables

- [ ] 7.1 Each figure/table has a caption ≥ 2 lines that includes interpretation or context. Do not just place it without explanation—reviewers will get lost.
- [ ] 7.2 Font size in all figures is ≥ 8pt and all labels are fully visible (not cropped).
- [ ] 7.3 Plots use colors that remain distinguishable when printed in grayscale—some reviewers will print your paper.
- [ ] 7.4 Each method mentioned in the results appears in either the legend or table column headers.
- [ ] 7.5 Figures appear at the top of pages rather than mid-text or at the bottom (soft rule, but improves readability).
- [ ] 7.6 Figures and tables are not redundant—each provides new or complementary information.
- [ ] Bonus: All figures are in **lossless formats** (e.g., PDF for vector graphics). Absolutely no low-resolution images allowed.

## 8. 🧱 Structure and Formatting

- [ ] 8.1 All LaTeX warnings and bad boxes have been resolved.
- [ ] 8.2 Section headers follow the standard paper structure (e.g., Introduction, Method, Experiments, etc.).
- [ ] 8.3 All appendix sections are explicitly referenced in the main text (e.g., “Appendix B.2 shows…”).
- [ ] 8.4 No **orphan lines** anywhere in the paper—avoid single-line section headers or short lines at the top/bottom of columns.
- [ ] 8.5 No two figures or tables are placed consecutively without explanatory text between them.

## 9. 📎 References

- [ ] 9.1 All references are in the correct format for the target venue.
- [ ] 9.2 All datasets, toolkits, and models used are cited.
- [ ] 9.3 At least one paper from the target venue (conference/journal) is cited.
- [ ] 9.4 Self-citations ≤ 20% of total citations.
- [ ] 9.5 BibTeX file has been deduplicated and spell-checked.

## 10. 🛑 Citation Sanity Check (LLM-Generated Risk)

- [ ] 10.1 All citations were **manually verified to exist**—title, authors, venue, and year match a real, published paper.
- [ ] 10.2 No hallucinated references from LLM tools are included.
- [ ] 10.3 If a citation was generated by ChatGPT, Copilot, or similar, it has been cross-checked on **Google Scholar**, **Semantic Scholar**, or publisher sites.

## 11. 🧠 Sanity Checks Before Submission

- [ ] 11.1 PDF compiles in Overleaf/TeX with no errors or bad boxes.
- [ ] 11.2 File name follows the submission guideline format (e.g., no underscores or author names if anonymized).
- [ ] 11.3 No author-identifying information exists in metadata, supplementary files, or file names. Check your code repository and images too.
- [ ] 11.4 The paper length complies with the page limit, including references and appendices (if counted).
- [ ] 11.5 The paper has been read start-to-finish by someone not on the author list, without them needing to stop for clarification.
- [ ] 11.6 All co-authors are listed and properly acknowledged—this is surprisingly often overlooked.
- [ ] 11.7 Bonus: After submission, log in from a different device and OS (e.g., Mac, Windows) to verify that the uploaded version renders correctly.
